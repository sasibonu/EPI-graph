# EPI-graph
EPI-graph helps to localize the epileptogenic network from interictal activity (using SEEG) recorded from brain structures of epilepsy patients. EPI-graph uses connectivity and graph theory measures to localize the EZ. The tool uses signal processing techniques including fourier transform and energy calculations to detect interictal discharges. Connectivity parameters nonlinear correlation (h2 index) and mutual information were implemented in the tool to measure the degree of synchronization across different brain areas. Graph theory measures were also implemented in the tool to predict the possible EZ.
